Course objectives:  
The objectives of the course are to facilitate the learners to 
● Appreciate the importance of Calculus and Matrix theory in Engineering. 
● Gain the knowledge of Calculus and Matrix theory concepts to implement them in their core 
domain. 
Improve their mathematical thinking and acquire skills required for sustained lifelong learning. 
Teaching-Learning Process (General Instructions) 
These are sample strategies which teachers can use to accelerate the attainment of the various course 
outcomes. 
● Lecture method(L) does not mean only traditional method, but different type of teaching 
methods may be adopted to develop the outcomes. 
● Show Video/animation films to explain functioning of various concepts. 
● Encourage collaborative (Group Learning) learning in the class. 
● Ask at least three HOT (Higher order Thinking) questions in the class, which promotes critical 
thinking. 
● Adopt Problem Based Learning (PBL), which fosters students’ Analytical skills, develop thinking 
skills such as the ability to evaluate, generalize, and analyze information rather than simply recall 
it. 
● Topics will be introduced in a multiple representation and encourage the students to come up with 
their own creative ways to solve them. 
Discuss how every concept can be applied to the real world and when that's possible, it helps to improve 
the students' understanding.

Course objectives:  
• Appreciate the importance of Calculus, Congruences and Matrix theory in computer and allied 
engineering science. 
• Gain the knowledge of Calculus, Congruences and Matrix theory concepts to implement them 
in their core domain. 
Improve their mathematical thinking and acquire skills required for sustained lifelong learning. 
Teaching-Learning Process (General Instructions) 
These are sample strategies which teachers can use to accelerate the attainment of the various course 
outcomes. 
• Lecture method (L) does not mean only traditional method, but different type of teaching 
methods may be adopted to develop the outcomes. 
• Show Video/animation films to explain functioning of various concepts. 
• Encourage collaborative (Group Learning) Learning in the class. 
• Ask at least three HOT (Higher order Thinking) questions in the class, which promotes 
critical thinking. 
• Adopt Problem Based Learning (PBL), which fosters students’ Analytical skills, develop 
thinking skills such as the ability to evaluate, generalize, and analyze information rather than 
simply recall it. 
• Topics will be introduced in a multiple representation and encourage the students to come up with 
their own creative ways to solve them. 
Discuss how every concept can be applied to the real world and when that's possible, it helps to 
improve the students' understanding.

Course objectives:  
To explain the concept of design thinking for product and service design and 
development 
To explain the fundamental concept of innovation and design thinking 
To discuss the methods of implementing design thinking in the real world. 
Teaching-Learning Process (General Instructions) 
These are sample Strategies; which teachers can use to accelerate the attainment of the various 
course outcomes. 
Lecturer method (L) does not mean only the traditional lecture method, but a 
different type of teaching method may be adopted to develop the outcomes. 
Show Video films to explain concepts 
Encourage collaborative (Group Learning) Learning in the class 
Ask at least three HOTS (Higher-order Thinking) questions in the class, which promotes 
critical thinking 
Adopt Problem Based Learning (PBL), which fosters students’ Analytical skills, 
develops thinking skills such as the ability to evaluate, generalize, and analyze 
information rather than simply recall it. 
Topics will be introduced in multiple representations. 
Show the different ways to solve the same problem and encourage the students to come 
up with their own creative ways to solve them. 
Discuss how every concept can be applied to the real world - and when that's possible, it 
helps improve the students' understanding.

Course objectives:  
• Appreciate the importance of calculus and numerical methods in the field of civil and mechanical 
engineering stream. 
• Gain the knowledge of calculus and numerical methods in the field of civil and mechanical 
engineering stream. 
• Improve their mathematical thinking and acquire skills required for sustained lifelong learning. 
Teaching-Learning Process (General Instructions) 
These are sample strategies which teachers can use to accelerate the attainment of the various course 
outcomes. 
• Lecture method(L) does not mean only traditional method, but different type of teaching methods may 
be adopted to develop the outcomes. 
• Show Video/animation films to explain functioning of various concepts. 
• Encourage collaborative (Group Learning) Learning in the class. 
• Ask at least three HOT (Higher order Thinking) questions in the class, which promotes critical thinking. 
• Adopt Problem Based Learning (PBL), which fosters students’ Analytical skills, develop thinking skills 
such as the ability to evaluate, generalize, and analyze information rather than simply recall it. 
• Topics will be introduced in a multiple representation and encourage the students to come up with their 
own creative ways to solve them. 
Discuss how every concept can be applied to the real world and when that's possible, it helps to improve 
the students' understanding.
